## The Interview

On February 9, 2026 I completed my first round technical interview for the **Software Engineer L3** position at Google. The round consisted of three parts: a coding challenge, a behavioral interview, and a Googleyness & Leadership assessment.

## Coding Challenge

The coding problem I received was very similar to **LeetCode #394 — Decode String**.

### Problem

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is repeated exactly `k` times. Brackets can be nested.

```
Input:  "3[a]2[bc]"    → Output: "aaabcbc"
Input:  "3[a2[c]]"     → Output: "accaccacc"
Input:  "2[abc]3[cd]ef" → Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```

### Optimal Solution — Two-Stack Approach

The most optimal solution uses two stacks: one for multipliers and one for accumulated strings. Single pass through the input, O(n) time.

```python
def decode_string(s: str) -> str:
    count_stack = []
    string_stack = []
    current = ""
    k = 0

    for ch in s:
        if ch.isdigit():
            k = k * 10 + int(ch)
        elif ch == "[":
            count_stack.append(k)
            string_stack.append(current)
            current = ""
            k = 0
        elif ch == "]":
            prev = string_stack.pop()
            repeat = count_stack.pop()
            current = prev + current * repeat
        else:
            current += ch

    return current
```

**How it works:**

- Digits build up the multiplier `k` (handles multi-digit numbers like `12[a]`)
- On `[` — push current state (multiplier + accumulated string) onto stacks, reset for the nested section
- On `]` — pop the previous string and multiplier, combine: `previous + current * repeat`
- Letters simply append to the current string

**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(d) space where d is the maximum nesting depth of brackets.

### Why This Approach Wins

A recursive solution also works but the iterative two-stack approach avoids call stack overhead and handles arbitrarily deep nesting without risk of stack overflow. It processes each character exactly once.

## Behavioral

Standard STAR-format questions about past projects, teamwork, conflict resolution, and how I handle ambiguity. I drew heavily on my experience at Airbus Defence and Space — cross-functional collaboration on production workflows and the 30% assembly time reduction project.

## Googleyness & Leadership

This round assessed cultural fit — intellectual humility, comfort with ambiguity, bias toward action, and collaborative instincts. Questions about navigating disagreements, supporting teammates, and taking initiative without being asked.

## Takeaways

- LeetCode #394 is a classic stack problem — recognizing the pattern immediately saves time
- The two-stack approach is clean and interviewer-friendly: easy to explain, easy to trace through examples
- Behavioral prep matters as much as coding prep at Google — they evaluate the whole engineer
