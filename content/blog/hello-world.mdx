## Why This Site

I needed a central place to document my projects, share progress updates, and serve as a digital CV for recruitment. Rather than using a template, I built this from scratch with a terminal aesthetic that reflects how I actually work — in the terminal, writing code.

## Design Decisions

The design is inspired by Vercel's Geist Pixel font and classic CRT terminal aesthetics:

- **Monospace everything** — Geist Mono as the single typeface
- **Dark + green** — The classic terminal color scheme
- **CRT scanlines** — Subtle CSS overlay for that retro monitor feel
- **ASCII art** — Figlet-rendered name as the hero element
- **Minimal UI** — No component libraries, just Tailwind utilities

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for static generation
- **Velite** for type-safe MDX content management
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **Vercel** for deployment

## What's Next

I'll be posting regular updates on my projects here — quantitative trading system progress, ESG agent improvements, and new experiments in ML and AI.
