## Overview

A comprehensive programming learning platform being built with Next.js and React Native. The platform features Docker-based sandboxed code execution, AI-powered problem generation, and a gamification system to keep learners engaged.

## Architecture

- **Monorepo** — Turborepo managing web (Next.js), mobile (React Native), and shared packages
- **Code Execution** — Docker containers for sandboxed, secure code evaluation
- **AI Integration** — OpenAI for problem generation and intelligent code assistance
- **Payments** — Stripe subscription system for premium content
- **Database** — PostgreSQL with type-safe queries

## Key Features

- Interactive coding challenges with real-time feedback
- AI-powered code assistant and problem generator
- Progress tracking with gamification (streaks, achievements, leaderboards)
- Cross-platform: web and mobile from shared codebase
- Production-grade CI/CD pipeline

## Status

Currently in active development. Core architecture and code execution engine are complete. Working on the AI integration and gamification layers.

## Tech Stack

TypeScript, Next.js, React Native, Turborepo, PostgreSQL, Docker, OpenAI API, Stripe, CI/CD
