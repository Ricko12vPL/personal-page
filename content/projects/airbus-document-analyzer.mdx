## Overview

A fully offline, air-gapped desktop application designed for high-confidentiality environments at Airbus Defence and Space. It enables document analysis, question answering, and semantic search using a local LLM — with zero network connectivity by design.

## Security Architecture

The system enforces complete network isolation:

- **Network Guard** — Patches Python's socket module to block ALL outbound connections
- **Audit Logging** — All blocked connection attempts are logged for compliance
- **Startup Verification** — Isolation is verified before any processing begins
- **Zero Telemetry** — No analytics, no cloud sync, no external calls

## Key Features

- **14+ File Formats** — PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, images (PNG, JPG, TIFF), Markdown, CSV
- **OCR Pipeline** — Tesseract-based text extraction from scanned documents and images
- **RAG Pipeline** — Semantic chunking → BGE embeddings → FAISS search → LLM generation with source citations
- **Conversation Memory** — Multi-turn context with session persistence and token management
- **Streaming Responses** — Real-time LLM output display in the PySide6 GUI

## Architecture

8-phase LangChain integration built iteratively:

1. LangChain wrappers for local LLM and embeddings
2. Conversation memory with session management
3. Advanced retrieval (multi-query + compression)
4. Structured output with Pydantic schemas
5. LCEL chain composition
6. SQLite caching layer
7. Qt streaming callbacks
8. Enhanced semantic chunking

## Tech Stack

Python, PySide6, LLaMA 3.1 (8B GGUF), LangChain, FAISS, sentence-transformers, Tesseract OCR, PyInstaller
