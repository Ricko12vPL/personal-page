## Overview

A comprehensive maze toolkit combining a Python backend for maze generation with a premium HTML5 Canvas web visualizer. The project demonstrates core algorithm implementations with beautiful, interactive visualizations.

## Algorithms

### Generation
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** — Recursive backtracker creating long, winding corridors
- **Kruskal's Algorithm** — Minimum spanning tree approach for more open mazes

### Pathfinding
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** — Guaranteed shortest path in unweighted grids
- **A* Search** — Optimal pathfinding with heuristic-guided exploration

## Technical Highlights

- Optimized data structures (TypedArrays, PriorityQueue) for performance
- Grid support up to 400x400 cells with smooth rendering
- Interactive zoom/pan controls for large mazes
- SVG export for high-quality output
- Step-by-step algorithm visualization with adjustable speed

## Tech Stack

Python, JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, TypedArrays, SVG
