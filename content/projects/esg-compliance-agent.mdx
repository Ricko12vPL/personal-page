## Overview

A production ESG compliance assessment system that uses AI to analyze company sustainability documents against ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards). The system features a local LLM for completely offline operation, making it suitable for confidential enterprise environments.

## Architecture

The system follows a 4-layer architecture with SOLID principles:

- **Presentation** — Interactive CLI with Rich terminal UI and 5 context modes
- **Application** — Command registry, process orchestration, report generation
- **Domain** — Core models, interfaces, ESRS compliance logic
- **Infrastructure** — RAG server (FastAPI on port 8001), data collectors, API clients

## Key Features

- **Local LLM** — Granite Tiny 4.0 (1.3B params, 4-bit GGUF) for zero-network inference
- **RAG Pipeline** — FAISS vector store with BGE embeddings for semantic document search
- **26 Data Sources** — News APIs, regulatory feeds, company reports, market data, carbon monitoring
- **10 ESRS Modules** — Full coverage: E1-E5 (Environmental), S1-S4 (Social), G1 (Governance)
- **Automated Reporting** — Professional HTML compliance reports with per-module scoring

## ESRS Coverage

Each module receives a compliance score (0-100) with uncertainty propagation:

- **E1** Climate Change — Scope 1/2/3 emissions, transition plans
- **E2-E5** — Pollution, Water, Biodiversity, Circular Economy
- **S1-S4** — Workforce, Supply Chain, Communities, Consumers
- **G1** — Business Conduct, Ethics, Governance

Python, FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, sentence-transformers, llama-cpp-python, Selenium, Rich, pytest
