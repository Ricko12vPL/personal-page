## Overview

X_Quant is a production-grade quantitative trading platform designed to compete with institutional-level hedge fund systems. Built from the ground up in Python, it implements a complete algorithmic trading pipeline from data ingestion through execution to risk management.

The system is currently running 24/7 as a live paper trading daemon connected to Interactive Brokers.

## Architecture

The platform follows a modular monolith architecture with 32 core modules:

- **Alpha Generation** — 30 atomic alpha signals with universal shift(1) anti-lookahead
- **ML Pipeline (v4.3)** — 4-layer institutional pipeline: 137 raw features → 411 normalized → IC stability selection → 6-model ensemble (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)
- **Signal Generation** — MetaEnsemble combining 7 base strategies through 6 sub-ensembles with IR-boost weighting
- **Execution Engine** — Enhanced Almgren-Chriss with TWAP/VWAP algorithms and Smart Order Routing
- **Risk Management** — VaR/CVaR (4 methods), 5-level drawdown controls, circuit breakers, regime-aware scaling

## Validation

The system uses institutional-grade statistical validation:

- **CPCV** — Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (12 folds, 5-day purge)
- **PBO** — Probability of Backtest Overfitting: 0.01 (target < 0.30)
- **DSR** — Deflated Sharpe Ratio: 1.189 (target > 1.0)
- **Hansen's SPA Test** — Superior Predictive Ability
- **Walk-Forward Efficiency** — 71.18% (target > 70%)

## Key Results

- Out-of-Sample Sharpe Ratio: **1.236**
- CAGR (net of costs): **16.97%**
- Maximum Drawdown: **13.05%**
- Win Rate: **68.7%**
- 11 of 16 strategies pass all 12 institutional checks
